// Note: Performance Obligations endpoints in Recurly API are read-only
// The API documentation shows only GET operations (get_performance_obligations and get_performance_obligation)
// No create, update, or delete operations are available for performance obligations
// Performance obligations are managed through the Recurly dashboard

// Since there are no query parameters for the performance obligations endpoints,
// no DTOs are needed for this service
